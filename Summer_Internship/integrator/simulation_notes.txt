Simulation Notes
----------------

1. Calculate the forces on all of the nodes
    - Include springs and viscous forces
2. Calculate the stress of the system
    - Using stress equation
    - V = sqrt(3)/2 W^2
3. Iterate through all nodes, sum the forces acting on each, displace each one accordingly.
4. Change the strain. γ = γ_0 sin(ωt)
